# Terminal-Bench 2 Setup

This directory is the paper reference scaffold for Terminal-Bench 2.0. The shipped scripts target Harbor with the `runloop` environment:

```bash
uv run harbor run ... -d "terminal-bench@2.0" -e runloop
```

## Requirements

- A working Anthropic API key.
- A Runloop/Daytona account with enough sandbox quota for the concurrency you plan to use.
- The `terminal-bench` package installed from this directory's `pyproject.toml`.
- Python 3.12.

Install:

```bash
cd reference_examples/terminal_bench_2
uv sync
```

## Environment Variables

The repo root ships `.env.example`, but the shell wrappers in `scripts/` source `.env` from this directory. In practice:

- Put the same `.env` file in this directory, or
- Export the needed variables in your shell before running the scripts.

As shipped, the code expects at least `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Running through runloop is highly recommended for large-scale runs.

The default model in this example is `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`. Override `HARBOR_MODEL` only if you intentionally want a non-default config.

## Task Set

- Dataset ID in the paper code: `terminal-bench@2.0`
- `meta_harness.py` defaults to the full TB2 dataset: 89 tasks, 2 search trials each
- `--full-eval` adds the optional 5-trial winner pass on the full dataset
- The paper submission metadata targeted `laude-institute/terminal-bench-2` commit `69671fbaac6d67a7ef0dfec016cc38a64ef7a77c`

## Smoke Check

```bash
uv run bash scripts/run_eval.sh agents.baseline_kira:AgentHarness full 1 1 -i extract-elf
```

## Recommended Bring-Up Order

For new harness ideas, do not start with the default 89x2 search loop.

1. Smoke-test a candidate on `extract-elf`.
2. Run the cheaper 30-task `hard` subset while the idea is still unstable.
3. Move to `uv run python meta_harness.py --iterations 1` once the idea looks promising.

Hard-subset example:

```bash
uv run bash scripts/run_eval.sh agents.baseline_kira:AgentHarness hard 1 10
```

The shell wrappers use `timeout` when available and fall back to `gtimeout` if GNU coreutils is installed on macOS. If neither command is present, the Harbor run still works but will not have an outer wall-clock timeout.

## Local Vs Remote Sandbox

As released, the scripts use `-e runloop`. If you want a different Harbor environment, change the environment flag in the shell wrappers or invoke `harbor run` directly with your local environment choice. The paper code does not ship a second local-sandbox path here.

## Version Note

The direct TB2 example dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml`:

- `harbor==0.3.0`
- `litellm==1.82.6`
- `python-dotenv==1.2.2`
- `tenacity==9.1.4`
- `terminal-bench==0.2.18` from `harbor-framework/terminal-bench` commit `1a6ffa9674b571da0ed040c470cb40c4d85f9b9b`

If you want a local lockfile for your environment, run `uv lock` from this directory.
