# Terminal-Bench 2

Paper reference experiment for Meta-Harness on Terminal-Bench 2.0. The default search config uses Harbor on the full 89-task TB2 dataset with 2 trials per task on Opus 4.6, matching the intended paper-style search setup in this release.

## Quick Start

Install:

```bash
cd reference_examples/terminal_bench_2
uv sync
```

Read setup details first:

```bash
sed -n '1,200p' SETUP.md
```

Start with a cheap smoke check:

```bash
uv run bash scripts/run_eval.sh agents.baseline_kira:AgentHarness full 1 1 -i extract-elf
```

When trying a new idea, validate it on the cheaper 30-task `hard` subset before paying for a full default search:

```bash
uv run bash scripts/run_eval.sh agents.baseline_kira:AgentHarness hard 1 10
```

Run one evolve iteration with the default full-dataset search config:

```bash
uv run python meta_harness.py --iterations 1
```

Add `--full-eval` if you also want the optional 5-trial winner pass on the full dataset.

## Key Files

- `.claude/skills/meta-harness-terminal-bench-2/SKILL.md`: proposer prior used by `meta_harness.py`.
- `agents/`: baseline agents and the write target for generated candidates.
- `prompt-templates/terminus-kira.txt`: prompt template used by `baseline_kira.py`.

## Runtime And Cost

With Opus 4.6 and a high-tier API key, the default 89x2 search run takes about 4-6 hours and costs roughly $500 _for each iteration_. The recommended bring-up path is to first smoke-test a candidate on the `extract-elf` task, then run the cheaper 30-task `hard` subset (which still contains plenty of signal for evaluation), and finally move to the full default run with all 89 tasks.

This is a cleaned-up version of the code we used for the paper. Please let us know if anything goes wrong.
